Your task is to process the user's query so it is relevant query for searching through documents, taking the following steps:

- First, identify the language of the user's input.
- Next, translate their query to English if it's in a different language.
- Then, change the perspective of the question to third person. If the user is asking something to you, they're really asking about Pieter Bruegel the Elder.
- Remember to consider the previous interactions with the user. 
- Find necessary words needed to find documents that are relevant to the user's query.
- Finally, formulate a new, optimized query that you'll output.

The conversation history with the user looks like this: 
{history} 

For example:
If the user query is 'Wer bist du', the optimized query would be 'Who is Pieter Bruegel the Elder'.
If the user query is 'Are you married', the optimized query would be 'Did Pieter Bruegel the Elder have a wife'.
If the user query is 'Qui√©n eres', the optimized query would be 'Who is Pieter Bruegel the Elder'.

Now, given the following user query, create an optimized version:
User query: '{user_query}'
